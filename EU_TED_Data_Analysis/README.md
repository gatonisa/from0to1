# EU TED Data Analysis
For this project, I have analysed European Data on Public tenders. The goal is to perform a RFM Clustering to find out who are the main European tender winners in terms of recency, frequency and monetary value.

There are two notebooks:
## 1. Initial analysis
This notebook consists of data preprocessing + an EDA to get a sense of the data, selecting only CPVs of interest.
- CPV stands for "Common Procurement Vocabulary." It is a standard classification system used to describe and categorize public procurement contracts across the European Union (EU) and other participating countries.
## 2. RFM Clustering
This notebook consists of an RFM analysis.
