# Unlocking Insights: European Public Tender Analysis with RFM Clustering - WIP (Unfinished)

In this project, I delve into the realm of European public tenders within the Information Technology (IT) sector to uncover valuable insights using RFM clustering. The goal is to identify key players in the IT sector based on their recency, frequency, and monetary value.

## Introduction
Public tenders are a vital component of the European market, shaping industries and economies. By applying RFM clustering to tender data in the IT sector, we aim to understand the dynamics of tender winners and their contributions to the technology landscape.

## Data Description
The project utilizes [European TED (Tenders Electronic Daily) data](https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/ted-csv?locale=en), a rich source of public procurement contracts. The data includes information on tender participants, contract details, and CPV codes (Common Procurement Vocabulary), providing a comprehensive view of the IT tender landscape. 


## Methodology
### 1. Initial Analysis
The initial notebook focuses on data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA). We filter the dataset to include only relevant CPV categories such as servers, IoT, software, networks, IT systems, and IT services.

### 2. RFM Clustering
The RFM clustering notebook dives into the heart of the analysis, applying RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to segment tender participants within the IT sector. By clustering participants based on their RFM scores, we uncover patterns and insights into the most active and valuable players in the IT tender landscape.

## Results and Insights
Through RFM clustering, we gain valuable insights into the European public tender landscape within the IT sector. We identify clusters of participants with distinct RFM profiles, shedding light on trends, preferences, and competitive dynamics within the technology sector.

## Future Directions
Looking ahead, there are several avenues for further exploration and refinement. Future iterations of the project could delve deeper into specific CPV categories, explore alternative clustering techniques, or incorporate additional features for analysis.
