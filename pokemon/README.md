# Welcome to the Pokémon Legendary Classification project! 🚀

In collaboration with Professor Samuel Oak, our mission is to unravel the defining traits of legendary Pokémon using machine learning. In this repository, you'll find:
* Dataset: please go on 'data' file to get the dataset `pokedex.csv` containing Pokémon features.
* Models Used:
  Decision Tree
  Extra Tree
  k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  Logistic Regression
  Voting Classifier (ensemble)

* Main goal: Classify Pokémon as legendary or not based on their attributes.
