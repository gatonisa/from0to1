# Microsoft Malware Detection ðŸ¦ 
This project is part of the TGS Kaggle competition hosted by Microsoft, which challenges data scientists to predict malware occurrences before they impact machines. The goal is to contribute effective techniques for enhancing security measures against the well-organized malware industry.

### Key Information:
- Kaggle Competition: TGS - Microsoft Malware Prediction Challenge
- Objective: Develop techniques for predicting malware occurrences in advance to protect machines.
- Dataset: Microsoft provides a comprehensive malware dataset to encourage progress in open-source predictive modeling (please check `data`folder).

### Analysis and Techniques Used:
In this notebook, I have explored various machine learning techniques to address the malware prediction challenge. Specifically, I implemented decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, and XGBoost to develop diverse models and improve prediction accuracy.
