# A fintech project: Easy Money ðŸ’°
This project contains the code and associated documentation for the data analysis conducted for EasyMoney. The analysis is divided into three main parts: Analysis of the Current Situation, Customer Portfolio Segmentation, and Sales Prediction.

### Part I: Analysis of the Current Situation
In this section, a structured methodology was applied, ranging from data collection and cleaning to exploratory analysis of EasyMoney's current situation. The idea behind the EDA is to get an overall idea of where the company is at in terms of sales, revenue, customer profiles, etc. To gain deeper insights, please refer to notebooks 01 and 02.

### Part II: Customer Portfolio Segmentation
A clustering approach was applied to divide the customer base into homogeneous groups based on different variables relevant to the company. Five distinct segments were identified, each with specific characteristics and behaviors. These are the main group0s, for more info on each group's features, please go to the end of notebook 03.

* I. Cluster 0 - Conservative Canarians
* II. Cluster 1 - Moderate University Students
* III. Cluster 2 - Senior Investors
* IV. Cluster 3 - Value Segment
* V. Cluster 4 - Young Individuals with Opportunities


### Part III: Sales Prediction
The goal was to predict which customers are likely to contract a new product the following month using a decision tree. The methodology used, the results obtained, and the conclusions of the analysis are detailed. To avoid redundancy, only one prediction model was updated (feel free to ask for the rest of them).

## Repository Structure
- code: Contains the scripts and code files used in the analysis and prediction.
- data: Data files used in the analysis.
- documentation: Detailed documentation of the analysis process, including this README file.
