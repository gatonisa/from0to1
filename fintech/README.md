# A fintech project: Easy Money ðŸ’°
This project contains the code and associated documentation for the data analysis conducted for EasyMoney. The analysis is divided into three main parts: Analysis of the Current Situation, Customer Portfolio Segmentation, and Sales Prediction.

### Part I: Analysis of the Current Situation
In this section, a structured methodology was applied, ranging from data collection and cleaning to exploratory analysis of EasyMoney's current situation. The idea behind the EDA is to get an overall idea of where the company is at in terms of sales, revenue, customer profiles, etc. 

### Part II: Customer Portfolio Segmentation
A clustering approach was applied to divide the customer base into homogeneous groups based on different variables relevant to the company. Five distinct segments were identified, each with specific characteristics and behaviors.

* I. Cluster 0 - Conservative Canarians:
This group has an average age of 29 years and low salaries compared to other groups.
Majority are university graduates.
Balanced gender ratio.
Primarily reside in Las Palmas.
Regarding accounts, most clients have multiple current accounts, some have debit cards, while payroll and crypto accounts are less common. As for savings products, most clients have little presence in this type of product. Regarding financing, some clients have credit cards, but their presence is limited compared to other products. In this group, clients tend to maintain a conservative distribution in their financial products, with a preference for current accounts over other products. This suggests a more cautious approach to financial management, with less participation in investment or financing products.

* II. Cluster 1 - Moderate University Students:
With an average age of 23 years and intermediate salaries, this group tends to be younger and have moderate incomes.
Majority are university graduates, predominantly women.
Primarily reside in Barcelona, Madrid, and Valencia.
Regarding accounts, most clients have multiple current accounts, and some have debit cards. As for savings products, most clients have little presence in this type of product. Regarding financing, very few have credit cards. Despite having moderate incomes, this group shows limited participation in financing products, such as credit cards. This may indicate a more cautious approach to debt and a more moderate and responsible financial management.

* III. Cluster 2 - Senior Investors:
With an average age of 43 years and intermediate salaries, this group tends to be older and have stable incomes.
Majority are individuals with a balanced gender ratio.
Primarily reside in Madrid and Barcelona.
Regarding accounts, most clients have multiple current accounts, many debit cards and crypto accounts, and some payroll accounts. In terms of savings products, long-term deposits stand out. Regarding financing, many clients have credit cards. With a greater propensity to invest in long-term deposits and a significant presence in credit cards, this group shows a more proactive attitude towards financial management and a greater willingness to take moderate risks in their investments and financing.

* IV. Cluster 3 - Value Segment:
With an average age of 37 years and high salaries, this group has significantly higher incomes compared to other groups.
Majority are individuals with a balanced gender ratio.
Primarily reside in Madrid and Barcelona.
Regarding accounts, almost all clients have payroll accounts and direct debits, as well as many debit cards, some crypto accounts, and few current accounts. As for savings products, almost all have pension plans, while some also have funds, securities, and long-term deposits, albeit to a lesser extent. Regarding financing, almost all have credit cards and some have loans. This group stands out for its active participation in a variety of financial products, including pension plans, funds, and securities. Their high participation in credit cards and loans suggests a more proactive attitude towards financing and a greater willingness to take financial risks.

* V. Cluster 4 - Young Individuals with Opportunities:
With an average age of 24 years and high salaries, this group tends to be younger but with high incomes.
Majority are university graduates, predominantly men.
Primarily reside in Madrid and Barcelona.
Regarding accounts, most clients have multiple current accounts, and some have debit cards and payroll accounts. As for savings products, most clients have little presence in this type of product. Regarding financing, very few have credit cards. Despite having high incomes, this group shows limited participation in financing products, such as credit cards. This may indicate a more conservative approach to financial management, with a preference for liquidity and a lower willingness to take on debt or financial risks.

### Part III: Sales Prediction
The goal was to predict which customers are likely to contract a new product the following month using a decision tree. The methodology used, the results obtained, and the conclusions of the analysis are detailed.
