# A fintech project: Easy Money ðŸ’°
This repository contains the code and associated documentation for the data analysis conducted for EasyMoney. The analysis is divided into three main parts: Analysis of the Current Situation, Customer Portfolio Segmentation, and Sales Prediction.

### Part I: Analysis of the Current Situation
In this section, a structured methodology was applied, ranging from data collection and cleaning to exploratory analysis of EasyMoney's current situation. The idea behind the EDA is to get an overall idea of where the company is at in terms of sales, revenue, customer profiles, etc. 

### Part II: Customer Portfolio Segmentation
A clustering approach was applied to divide the customer base into homogeneous groups based on different variables relevant to the company. Five distinct segments were identified, each with specific characteristics and behaviors.

### Part III: Sales Prediction
The goal was to predict which customers are likely to contract a new product the following month using a decision tree. The methodology used, the results obtained, and the conclusions of the analysis are detailed.
