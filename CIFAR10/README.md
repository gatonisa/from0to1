# CIFAR1O 
CIFAR-10  is an established computer-vision dataset used for object recognition. It is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images containing one of 10 object classes, with 6000 images per class. 

## Goal of the project ðŸš€
The goal of this project is to predict the category an image belongs to out of 10 labels {airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck}. For this purpose, I have used NN.

## Structure
The structure of this project goes as follows:
Each file under the `code` folder contains a model, as the number NN_model_XX increases, the NN complexity does so as well. The idea is to show how I've progressively improved my model.
